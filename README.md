Llama â€” a terminal file manager.

Why another file manager? I wanted something simple and minimalistic,
something to help me with faster navigation in the filesystem. A cd &
ls replacement. So I build "llama". It allows to quickly navigate
with fuzzy searching; cd integration is quite simple. Open vim right
from the llama. That's it. Simple and dumb as a llama.

## Install

```
go get github.com/antonmedv/llama
```

Or download [prebuild binaries](https://github.com/antonmedv/llama/releases).

Put the next function into **~/.bashrc**:

```bash
function ll {
  llama "$@" 2> /tmp/path && cd "$(cat /tmp/path)"
}
```

Use **ll** to navigate the filesystem. Note: we need a such helper as the child
process can't modify the working directory of the parent process.
